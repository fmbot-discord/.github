# .fmbot

These are the public repositories for .fmbot.

.fmbot is a social Discord bot that provides interesting music statistics and 
insights for you, your friends and your fellow server members.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions. If you would like to make a major change or feature we
recommend discussing it with the maintainer first, either through an issue or
on [our support Discord](https://discord.gg/fmbot).

If you make an impactful pull request you will also get the contributor status in 
the publicly hosted bot. This is applied at the maintainers discretion.

Note: Since there is only one main maintainer at the moment most git and release
workflows are based around that. If more developers are willing to help 
with this project, there will probably a more organized release guideline.
